Deployed at: https://hotel-review123.herokuapp.com/

## Problem Statement
Given a review by a Customer we have to determine whether it belongs to Positive review or Negative review. Eg:1 i.e. Review 1: Wow this place really gives me good vibe as well as the fish cury is also Awesome as always. Ans: Positive Review. Eg:2 i.e. Review 2 This Dish is not at all tasty as well as waitress was a little slow in service. Ans: Negative Review. So our main Task is to predict wheatear the given review is positive or negative i.e. Binary Classification.
